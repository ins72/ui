### 🔧 Issues Fixed

#### 1. API Route Filtering Issues
- **Problem**: All API routes were using product-specific fields (`title`, `description`, `status`, `category`) in their WHERE clauses
- **Solution**: Updated each API to use model-specific fields:
  - Products: `title`, `description`, `status`, `category`
  - Customers: `name`, `email`
  - Transactions: `type`, `status`
  - Comments: `content`
  - Messages: `content`
  - Notifications: `type`, `message`
  - Income: `type`, `source`
  - Payouts: `status`, `method`
  - Refunds: `reason`, `status`
  - Statements: `period`

#### 2. Database Seeding
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Records Created**: 50+ records across all models
- **Data Quality**: Realistic, varied data for testing

#### 3. Dependencies
